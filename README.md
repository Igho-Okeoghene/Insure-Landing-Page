### What I learned

One new thing I learnt while building this landing page would be, how to position background images.

One major challenge I encountered was when I tried to change the color of the svg icons underneath "We're different" section. I googled about it and found out ways to have that done, but I decided to use font awesome icons instead, because the codes were less crowded on the system and I prefer when the svg path is not entirely written out in my code.


### Useful resources

- [How To Change The Colour of SVG](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - This helped me to learn more about how to change svg image color on hover.
- [Background Position](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/) - I had a tough time positioning my images on my background, this resource helped me to understand how background-position works.
