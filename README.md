## My process
- I mapped out the elements and tags for each section.
- Then, designed for mobile and desktop using css and media queries.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One new thing I learnt while building this landing page would be, how to position background images on backound colours.

One major challenge I encountered was when I tried to change the color of the svg icons underneath "We're different". I googled about it and saw amazing ways to have that done, but I decided to use font awesome icons instead, because the codes were less crowded on the system and I prefer when the svg path is not entirely spelt out on my html page.


### Continued development

I recently learnt more about CSS Grid. I have always preferred Flexbox to Grid, but I'm hoping to use CSS Grid for my subsequent projects.

### Useful resources
